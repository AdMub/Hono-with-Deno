##  [Description](#description)

In this campaign, you will dive in and learn another middleware framework for backend development, Hono ðŸ”¥.
Combined with the power of Deno ðŸ¦•, you will explore how to create backend APIs using Web standards.

You will learn to:

Create API routes.

Generate mock data using faker and zod factory.

Perform CRUD operations with SQLite.

Implement protected routes using authentication and authorization logic.

Fuel up and begin your API development with Hono ðŸ”¥ and Deno ðŸ¦•.

##  [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To complete this quest, ensure you have:

Familiarity with JavaScript and TypeScript.

A working development environment of VSCode.

##  [Learning Outcomes](#Learning-Outcomes)

After completing this campaign, you will be able to:

Build APIs using Hono and Deno.

Create protected routes with Hono.

Include tests for your backend.

##  [Quest Details](#Quest-Details)

### Introduction

This quest continues your journey in API development with Hono and Deno, focusing on:

Creating, replacing, updating, and deleting data.

Securing API endpoints using authentication and authorization.

##  [Project Setup](#Project-Setup)

### Requirements

Install Deno on your machine. Follow the official Deno installation guide.

#### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

bash:

git clone <repository_url>

cd <repository_name>

2. Install dependencies:

bash:

deno task install

3. Start the server:

bash:

deno task serve


##  [Steps](#Steps)

### Step 1: Cryptographic Logic

Install additional dependencies

bash:

deno add 'jsr:@std/crypto' 'jsr:@std/encoding' 'jsr:@zaubrik/djwt' 'npm:zod@3.23.8'

Create a generateToken.ts file to generate API keys.

### Step 2: Auto Populate Multiple Databases for Mock Tests

Populate databases with mock data using faker and zod factory.

### Step 3: Adding Tests

Write test cases for schemas using @std/assert.

### Step 4: Protecting API Endpoints

Add checkAuth middleware to secure PUT and DELETE endpoints.

### Step 5: Adding Login and Register Middleware

Implement registration and login endpoints for admin users.

### Step 6: Using the New API

Use Postman to interact with the API.
